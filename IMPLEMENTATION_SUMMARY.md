- Database persistence enabled

## Production Setup Requirements

### For SMS Functionality:
1. Create Twilio account
2. Get Twilio credentials:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - Phone Number
3. Update environment variables
4. Test SMS delivery

### For File Upload:
- Already production-ready
- Supports up to 50MB files
- Progress tracking works across all file sizes
- Error handling and recovery implemented

## Testing Instructions
